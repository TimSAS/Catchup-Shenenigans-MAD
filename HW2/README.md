## HW2 
Due Saturday 2/23 @ midnight. :alarm_clock:   

Make the [app](./doc/app-4-hw2.png) described in slide 12 of the slide set from week 3 (posted on canvas).  
It contains 4 activities:
1. MainActivity (wire it to launch the others)
2. True/False with regular buttons (start on that one)
3. True/False with radio buttons
4. Multiple Choice Activity  

**Read the slides**. I give code and instruction there. Clone and start from this repo. This gives a structure for your project. Do not change the names of the activities and observe that I am already giving you the questions.xml and multiple_questions.xml files. See [github-integration.pdf](./doc/github-integration.pdf)


**Extra credit :credit_card:: (i.e do these only if you are really cool  :thumbsup::heart_eyes:)**  
1. Make your code work for a varying number of multiple choice answers. For example if you look inside multiple_questions.xml you will find that each of the two questions has exactly three answers. How would you make this work if say a question had five possible answers?
2. Change your code to accomodate questions that accept more than one choice (not mutually exclusive). i.e retain the radio behavior of the answers with one choice but additionally some questions will have 2 or 3 answers that must be selected together to form a correct response. As an example see question 3 in Erik's document here: [https://github.com/NCF-Mobile/Group-App/tree/master/Questions-list](https://github.com/NCF-Mobile/Group-App/tree/master/Questions-list).  You will need to use checkboxes instead of radio buttons only for those questions. But how will you flag those question in the xml? How would you deal with multiple correct answers in programming? Do this in a systematic way (do not make new activities).
3. Create an icon for your app. Did you do the reading assignments?
