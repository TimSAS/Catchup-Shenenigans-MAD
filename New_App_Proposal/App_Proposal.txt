(new app idea 4.2.2019)

App name: Task Obliterator

Description: Idea came to me when I read a small article named something like this "Conquering procrastination through gaming addiction"
	(original article is in russian, but here's a link to it: https://habr.com/ru/post/439318/). Idea is pretty simple: author was trying
	to work on his own game in his spare time and at one point he noticed that in four months or so he has spent only about 20 hours on it.
	To combat this situation, which I definitely relate to, he decided to approach it in somewhat gaming-related way: basically any game 
	rewards its players for achieving some game-related goals, being that statistics of headshots or increase in numbers in some way or another.
	Author took that main idea and created an Excel file to track his game-development in each specific category(graphics, sounds, animation...).
	He set a goal for himself to work about 10 hours every week on it, and opposed to many to-do apps, it not only kept the statistics but also took 
	the goal(10 hrs) in account, resulting in negative score if behind schedule, positive otherwise. Here's a recreation of how approximately that 
	looked like:
	
	[excell screen here]

	Author achieved pretty exceptional results: 49 hours in 6 weeks when he just started doing it. And then he even increased his weekly goal to 14hrs
	and was able to maintain it, basically has become addicted to his work =) The goal is to make an app that you can set daily/weekly/monthly/yearly
 	goals and your "score" will roll over. Also it should be possible to create a regular to-do lists. To keep it even more interesting, I'm thinking of
 	implementing some "game rules" so that you can potentially "loose" and your highscore will be recorded, which might motivate user even harder 
	(by trying to beat his/her previous highscore). Also I thought of having different rule sets so you can keep this "game" even more interesting,
 	by changing some of the priorities in the rules or by making it in some ways easier/harder.
	
	Also, compared to many apps that do provide some form of statistic, the statistic in my app should be more relevant since it's going to track time
	+ individual tasks.

Similar apps:
1. Todoist - probably the least in terms of features but is pretty straight forward. No custom lists it seems. Things I liked: not many "screens" (only 
	about 3 main "windows"), ability to set daily goal in terms of tasks completed + set the days off (when your daily goal streak is paused). Also felt
	like it's one of the fastests ones in it's operation from the three I selected to review.

2. Any.do - nice app, liked it better than Wunderlist. Nice things: custom lists, priority system within lists, integration with your google calendar, nice UI 
	animations + looks simple but nice (design flows nice if it makes sense). In terms of statistics + motivation aspect, again, not much of that - 
	only a list of completed tasks + time of their completion.

3. Wunderlist - pretty straight forward to-do list app. From nice features: allows to create different lists for different categories you might have + being 
	able to share a list with somebody and check it off together. Not much in terms of meaningfull statistics (saw only number of tasks completed which
	is kinda hard to relate to productivity in precise manner).
